## History

### ARMv2

ARM originally stood for Acorn RISC Machine, but later renamed to Advanced RISC Machines. Arm Holdings develops instruction set architectures (ISAs) and licenses them to others. The first version was tested on 26 April 1985. The latest version that is used in products is ARMv9.2-A.

### MIPS R2000

This architecture (microprocessor) was developed by MIPS Computer Systems in 1986. It was the first commercial implementation of the RISC architecture. R2000 users included Ardent Computer, DEC, Silicon Graphics, Northern Telecom and MIPS's own Unix workstations.
